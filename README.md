# Algorithms For Heart Disease Prediction CMP263 UFRGS 2022

Auxiliary data for reproducibility of the paper 'Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms for the Prediction of Heart Disease'.
This is the final project for the course CMP263 - Machine Learning taught by Prof. Dr. Mariana Recamonde Mendoza at UFRGS (Brazil).
The authors of the project are Arthur Medeiros, Fabio Pereira and Gustavo Loguercio.<br/>
<br/>
DATA<br/>
The dataset is named 'dados_coracao_ML.csv'. It does not require any modification and should be on the same folder during the execution of any of the code files.<br/>

CODE<br/>
The file 'KNN_RandForests.py' refers to both KNN and Random Forests.<br/>
The file 'Bayes.py' refers to the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.<br/>
The file 'LogisticRegression.py' refers to the Logistic Regression algorithm.<br/><br/>

LIBRARIES<br/>
All the experiments were performed using Python 3.<br/>
All libraries can be installed through python's package manager pip.<br/>
Numpy - pip install numpy<br/>
Matplotlib - pip install matplotlib<br/>
Pandas - pip install pandas<br/>
Scikit-learn - pip install scikit-learn<br/>
